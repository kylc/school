# Describe your career goals

My primary goal is to explore the field of Computer Science as fully as
possible.  I hope to have the chance to explore the latest programming languages
and to be on the forefront of the expanding subfield of computer vision.

# Describe how you intend to accomplish your goals and how your program of study
will facilitate that

I am attempting to use my time here at Oregon State University to explore my
favorite fields of Computer Science, computer vision and graphics.  I have been
able to participate in a number of projects that have facilitated this
exploration.  Last year I had the privilege of working with the Intel Learning
Company on a project that required complex 3D visualizations.  We were able to
explore the latest in browser-based 3D display technology.  This year, I have
been working on a research project to implement stereoscopic vision for our
robotics clubâ€™s aerial vehicle.  I have taken up a leadership role in this
project by initially brainstorming the idea, and then seeking out funding
independently.

I feel that opportunities are available within EECS for whatever interests a
student has, and I feel as though I am taking full advantage of these
opportunities.
