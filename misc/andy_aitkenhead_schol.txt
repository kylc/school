Computers have become ubiquitous in today's world, and computer scientists are
in high demand to program them.  My favorite subject is computer vision, a
subfield within computer science concentrating on building systems that allow
computers to recognize their environments.  Computer vision is becoming
important in the medical field, in which one use is to analyze microscopy or
X-ray images to make diagnoses.  Computer vision is also becoming more and more
important in industry.  It can be used to inspect products for quality control
or can be used for optical-based sorting.

One of my favorite applications of computer vision is in robotic navigation.  If
a robot is able to inspect its surroundings and construct an internal
representation, then it can autonomously move through its environment.
Autonomous robots using computer vision are currently being used by NASA to
explore Mars and are making their way into everything from airplanes to
consumer cars.

Modern computer vision is still a young field and new applications are
constantly being discovered.  I am excited to be a part of the field can't wait
to see how it progresses.
