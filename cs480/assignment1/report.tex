\begin{description}

\item[Specification] The purpose of this milestone is to begin thinking about
how the translation between infix and postfix syntax trees will work in our
compilers. It also gave us an introduction to writing Gforth, which will
obviously be necessary once we target it in our compilers.

\item[Processing] I read through the Gforth manual to gain an understanding of
the language. I then translated the infix code samples to postfix, and used my
knowledge of Gforth to translate that to valid programs.

\item[Testing Requirement] This assignment was very easy to test for
correctness. I was simply able to check that my program compiled and ran in
Gforth. I also verified the math by hand.

\item[Retrospective] I learned a great deal about how to use Gforth. By the end
of the assignment, I really had a handle on how stack-based languages work.
