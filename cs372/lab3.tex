\begin{enumerate}
  \item Source IP Address: \texttt{192.168.1.102}

  \item Protocol: ICMP

  \item The IP header length is 20 bytes.  The total length is 84 bytes,
        including the header.  Therefore, the payload is $84 - 20 = 64$ bytes.

  \item The datagram has not been fragmented, as the "more data coming" flag is
        not set.

  \item The identification and the TTL differ for each echo request.

  \item The lengths, protocol, and source and destination addresses stay
        constant.  The addresses must remain the same as we need to continue to
        attempt to reach the same host to test each router in-between.

  \item The identification number is incremented by one for each request.

  \item The identification is \texttt{0x0000} and the TTL is 246.

  \item These fields remain constant for all messages received from the first
        hop router.  The TTL will not change as the packets are only making one
        hop, so the TTL is only decremented once.  The identification does not
        change because the datagrams are not fragmented.

  \item The 2000 byte message was split into two datagrams, one 1500 bytes and
        the other 548 bytes.

  \item The packet's ``More fragments'' bit is set, so the destination knows to
        expect more data.  The fragment offset is 0, so the destination knows it
        is the first piece.  The length of the first datagram is 1500 bytes.

  \item The fragment offset is non-zero, so this cannot be the first piece.
        There are no more fragments because the ``More fragments'' bit is not
        set.

  \item The total length, more fragments flag, fragment offset, and header
        checksum all change between the two datagrams.

  \item The 3500 byte echo request was split into three datagrams, two of 1500
        bytes and a third of 568.

  \item The same headers change is in the two-fragment example above: the total
        length, more fragments flag, fragment offset, and header checksum.
