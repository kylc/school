Introduction
============
In my proposed course, Building Open Source Software, students will learn about
the tools and techniques commonly used in free software projects.  Open source
software is software to which the source code is freely available, as opposed to
proprietary software.  Some examples include the Firefox web browser,
OpenOffice, and the Linux operating system.

This will be a senior-level Computer Science course, and the course number will
be 451.  Students should have already completed both Software Engineering I and
Software Engineering II, as well as the Operating Systems course.  Both computer
science and electrical & computer engineering students could benefit from
learning about open source and free software.

Course Description
==================
In CS451 Building Open Source Software, students will learn the tools and
processes used in free software projects.  They will then apply what they have
learned by analyzing two large open source projects.

Students should leave the course with an understanding of version control,
communication tools, the open source process, and how to contribute to open
source.

Rationale
=========

This class should be offered for a number of reasons.

* Students currently learn techniques for developing proprietary software, but
  open source uses entirely different methods.
* Open source software is a great way for students to learn about new
  technologies and fill in their resumes.
* There are many careers available in open source development.  Google and
  Mozilla are just two examples.
* Open source is an easy way to be exposed to large real-world projects outside
  of a corporate environment.

Schedule
========

The schedule will start out with an introduction to open source.  Students will
then learn about common communication tools, and then version control systems.
In weeks 5 and 6 they will learn about open source development patterns.  The
rest of the course schedule will be comprised of a project analyzing two pieces
of open source software: Mozilla Firefox and the Linux Kernel.  Both of these
projects are based on different contribution methodologies, which will be
contrasted by students.

Resources
=========

Some resources that students may find helpful include:

* The Free Software Foundation, which provides services for open source and free
  software licensing.
* The Open Source Wikibook, containing an overview of the history of open
  source, open source philosophy, and common licensing methods.
* GitHub, which can be used as a directory of open source projects.

Conclusion
==========

To conclude, CS451 will teach students about open source and free software.
Students stand to gain a lot by learning about these topics, especially in
employment.  For the reasons outlined above, CS451 Building Open Source Software
should be added to the eCampus curriculum.
